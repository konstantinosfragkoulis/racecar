# Racecar

This is my code for the Racecar course by MIT. My solutions to the labs are not the best nor the most efficient, but they work.

This code is not meant to be copied, but rather to be used as a reference. If you are taking the course, I recommend you to try to solve the labs by yourself.

The code is not properly commented and ~~some~~ most of the times it is not very readable. In the very unlikely case that you want to use this code, and you don't understand something, feel free to ask me.

This code was used in the Panhellenic competition Racecar Challenge 2023.
